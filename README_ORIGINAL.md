# Gradient-Based Counterfactual Explanations

This repository contains the official implementation of DiPACE and GradCFA, two methods developed to generate flexible, interpretable, and plausible counterfactual explanations for machine learning models using gradient-descent.

These methods were developed as part of early PhD research exploring how to improve interpretability and flexibility in counterfactual explanations.

Example usage is shown in the notebooks binary_notebook.ipynb and mc_notebook.ipynb.

## Method Overview:

### DiPACE: Diverse and Plausible Counterfactual Explanations

- Published at [ICAART 2025](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2025/132191/132191.pdf)
- Selected and accepted for post-publication in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (accepted: 01/08/2025, publication expected in December 2025).

DiPACE uses a weighted sum loss function including objectives for:
- validity: encouraging correctly classified CFs (hinge loss minimisation)
- diversity: encouraging multiple distinct CFs per instance (DPP distance maximisation)
- plausibility: encouraging CFs which align with the data distribution (kNN distance minimisation)
- proximity: encouraging CFs with minimal distance between the original and CF values (L1 distance minimisation)
- sparsity: encouraging CFs with minimal features changing (hamming distance minimisation)


### GradCFA: Gradient-Based Counterfactual and Feature Attribution Explanations

- Published in [IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10930810) (18/03/2025)

GradCFA builds on DiPACE by integrating feature attribution through gradient magnitudes, providing insight into the influence of each feature in counterfactual generation.
